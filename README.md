# spotifyclone.github.io
Spotify website in 2019


This is a little challenge that I did back in 2019/2020 when I was taking a course on advanced CSS and Bootstrap. I cloned Spotify's website in Brazil to practice my skills. I focus particularly in making the page fully responsible to different screensizes and mobile-friendly. The layout changes and adapts to the space.
